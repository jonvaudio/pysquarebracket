Python terminal escape code implementation, very direct and easy to use. Two uses:

1) Display formatted text to the terminal in normal mode
2) (Optionally) use the `alternate_mode()` context (ie `with alternate_mode(): ...`) to implement a full screen terminal app that handles restoring the terminal session afterwards for you.
